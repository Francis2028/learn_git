My Learning Progress & Next Career Step

Completing my software development course at GoMyCode has been a huge step in my career journey. When I first started, I had basic knowledge, but throughout the Bootcamp I gained real hands-on experience in both frontend and backend development. Working with tools like React, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB helped me understand how real applications are built from start to finish.

I also learned how to use Git, test and debug my code, structure projects, and work in a more organized way. The Bootcamp pushed me to think differently, solve problems on my own, and write cleaner, more efficient code. The projects I built showed me how features connect together—APIs, authentication, UI components, and databases—and gave me more confidence as a developer.

Now that I’ve completed the program, I feel ready to take the next step in my career. I know I still have a lot to learn, but I’m motivated to keep improving, build more projects, and apply everything I’ve learned in a real work environment. This experience has made me more focused and excited about the future, and I’m looking forward to joining a team where I can grow, contribute, and continue building my skills.
